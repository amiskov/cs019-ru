# # The Ultimate 90-Day Bodyweight Training Plan
https://breakingmuscle.com/fitness/the-ultimate-90-day-bodyweight-training-plan

The program is based on the same style of training I did in Kenpo Karate and will help you get ripped. Why? Because it combines three important components:
 
- **No Rest Between Each Exercise**: Below, you will see a series of exercises. After you complete one exercise, you’ll move immediately to the next. You won’t take any rest. If you have to get a brief sip of water, that’s fine, but the goal is to take as little rest between sets as possible. Why is this important? Because you are conditioning. The workouts mimic a fight. In a fight, you don’t get to take rests.
- **Keeping Track of Your Reps**: After each set, write down your number of reps. Every time you perform an exercise, you will strive to get as many reps as you can. For example, if you did 26 Hindu push ups on Monday, then you’ll strive to get 27 or 28 on Wednesday. Will you be able to increase your reps every workout for every exercise? No. But it’s important to strive to achieve it.
- **Getting in the Right Mental Framework**: I kid you not, this workout plan is tough. It may look easy on paper, but it is hard. Most workouts allow you to take sixty to ninety seconds between sets. Other plans don’t require you to go to full fatigue. This plan requires you to not rest and go to full fatigue with each set. You’ll need to get in the right mental framework to get through. So realize beforehand that it's going to be challenging. This plan delivers amazing results in terms of fat loss, conditioning, and muscle development - but it is not for the faint of heart.

## Program Details
Each workout is comprised of upper-body, lower-body, core, and whole-body exercises. So, you get a full body workout every time you train. Many of these exercises will be new to you.
